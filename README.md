# Welcome to my first website! # 
### I have made a website which is similar to [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com), which is a social news aggregation, web content rating and disuccsion website. It allows registered members to submit content to the site  through links, images, videos etc. These articles can be voted up and down by another user whether they like or dislike the article. A user is able to comment on another users article and each comment can be either up/downvoted. ###
